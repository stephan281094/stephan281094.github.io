        Hi there! My name is Stephan de Vries. I'm currently 19 years old, I study software engineering at the
        <a href="http://hva.nl">Hogeschool van Amsterdam</a> and I am engaged with the girl of my dreams: Steffanys
        Gómez!
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Personal</strong><br>
        Steffanys lives in Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela (which is about 8000 kilometers away from The Netherlands). She is
        the source of my motivation and inspiration. Steffanys and I get to see each other once a year, which obviously
        is very difficult for both of us. But our love is strong! We're 100% sure that we want to spend the rest of our
        lives together. Whether we will live in Venezuela, The Netherlands or any other country. ♥

        <strong>Education</strong><br>
        When I was in senior general secondary education I started learning programming on my calculator. Which really
        caught my interest. I wanted to explore the possiblities of programming. At first I started with a simple
        program that could add two numbers together and display the result. Soon after that I discovered how to make
        more interactive programs. So I created a game! It really made me enthusiastic and it enlarged my desire of
        learning more about the magical world of programming!<br>
        That's why I decided to study software engineering at the <a href="http://hva.nl">Hogeschool van Amsterdam</a>
        after passing for my final exams. And I must say, I'm still happy with that choice! I've learned a lot since I
        started studying. Not only I learned about programming and computer technology, but I also learned about social
        skills and working in teams. I've learned a lot and I'm eager to learn even more! I see a world of possibilities
        when it comes to computer technology. And I can't wait to step inside and do what I love doing the most:
        Programming.

        <strong>Work</strong><br>
        When I first started studying I had no idea whether or not I would be able to find a job. Or if I'd even be
        qualified enough to start working. In the end I was amazed to find out how fast one can get a job when you know
        how to program.<br>
        I started working at <a href="http://quickpillow.com">QuickPillow</a> as a (frontend) developer.
        It's a very challenging job, but I'm learning a lot and I enjoy doing it! My boss is very flexible, which
        makes this job ideal for me in combination with school.
        <br>
        <br>
        Whenever I have some spare time I enjoy working on my own projects. This year alone I've been working on
        various libraries and frameworks that can be enjoyed by everybody, since it's all open source. Together with
        <a href="royjbe.bugs3.com">Roy Bes</a> I've created a graphical library and a tiny MVC PHP framework. I've
        created my very own micro jQuery library called "scrollify" which disables parent scrolling and I've helped
        redesigning an open source timeline library.

        <strong>Music and sound design</strong><br>
        Since I was born I have always been studious, I like learning about anything! There's not one thing I'm
        not interested in. Due to being so curious to know everything I was dying to know how to make your own music
        (mainly trance music). So I found this program called 'FL Studio' that is an incredible DAW (Digital Audio
        Workstation). It allows me to save melodies playing inside of my head and put it into an actual track. After a
        year I became very familiar with FL Studio, meaning that I was able to create my own professional tracks. I
        learned everything about oscillators, equalization, filters and sampling.
