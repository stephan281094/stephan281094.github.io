                    Scrollify.js is a micro (0.263 kb) jQuery library that disables parent scrolling.
                    Personally I hate it when I'm scrolling on a website inside some sort of container
                    and when I reach the bottom of the scrolling container, the whole page continues with scrolling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's why I decided to create a very tiny library that disables this. You can simply
                    include a minified version of scrollify.js on your website, add a class to the container
                    you want to apply scrollify to and call scrollify.
                    Since it's such a small library that only took me half an hour to make, I decided
                    to make this library open source. A lot of people cope with this problem and I think it'd be
                    rude of me not to share something this simple and small.

                    As the name 'scrollify.js' implies, it's a JavaScript library. However, I used
                    <a href="http://coffeescript.org">coffeescript</a> to build the
                    library. You can see the code in the image above or find it at the
                    <a href="https://github.com/stephan281094/scrollify.js">git repository</a>.

                    You're probably wondering how the micro library works.<br>
                    Basically, when you hover over the element you're scrolling in, scrollify disables
                    the parent's scroll. In most cases you want to disable scrolling on the HTML body element.
                    But that's not always the case, which is why I've added the feature that enables you to set what element
                    you want to disable for scrolling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can do this by providing a parameter, like so:
                    <code class="language-css">$('.scrollable').scrollify(".container");</code>
