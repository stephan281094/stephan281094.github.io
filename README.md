# Portfolio

This is my portfolio website. I'm planning on adding a blog here,
so people can see what projects I am working on and more.
I'll also be uploading pictures of projects I have worked on
and I'll add the basic things that a portfolio website needs.

If you see a typo somewhere, please create an issue so I can fix it! Thanks.

**At the moment** I am busy with a complete redesign of my website,
because I want to make it look more professional. I'm also working quite
a lot on another project that I started with a friend of mine. The name
of the repository is CodeGlimpse. Check it out [here](https://github.com/CodeGlimpse/CodeGlimpse)!
